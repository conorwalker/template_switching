**enrichment** </br>
identify enrichment of template switch loci within various genomic elements (Fig. 6)


**motifs** </br>
identify enriched DNA sequence motifs around ancestral event loci (Fig. S7)


**physical_properties** </br>
_dna\_flexibility_: calculate DNA bendability around template switch loci (Fig. 7a) </br>
_mfe_: calculate GC-regressed DNA MFE secondary structures around template switch loci (Fig. 7a,b,c)


**process_msas** </br>
identify candidate events from multiple alignments of the great apes, filter
these events according to statistical significance and several quality thresholds,
resolve their phylogenetic placement and report summary statistics
(underlies Figs. 4, 5, S3, S4; Table S1)


**sampling_unidirectional_probabilities** </br>
randomly sample unidirectional pairHMM log probabilities of alignment blocks
from each pairwise species alignment to generate per-base aligment log-probability distributions (Fig. S8)


**simulations** </br>
evolutionary simulations of template switch events to establish a significance
threshold on the log of the ratio between the probability of either a unidirectional
alignment or a template switch alignment (Figs. 3, S1)
